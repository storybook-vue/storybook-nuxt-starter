# Not a Minimal Starter for Storybook for Nuxt Project

check [Storybook Nuxt preset package](https://github.com/storybook-vue/storybook-nuxt) 

## Setup and configuration 

This demo contains:

- 🌐 Global components : NuxtLink, NuxtWelcome, NuxtLayout ...  bref you can use them all
  
- 💻 Modules : @nuxt/ui , i18n, @nuxt/image, pinia, nuxt-vuetify ... bref you can add any module
  
- 🚘 Autoimports :( components, composables ... bref you can add your own.
  
- 📃 Pages :( Nuxt full pages example, ... bref you know what you should do.


I thought for moment about creating a clear document for users to get this working.

### Bref run 

`pnpm i & pnpm storybook`


### NB: 
- this repo uses a fork for `@storybook/vue3` to enable early testing for users utill my PR got merged
  
- if you have your existing nuxt project run `npx storybook-nuxt init` to install,config and run storybook

GOOD LUCK 🤎
